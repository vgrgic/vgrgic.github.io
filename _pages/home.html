LeanArch provides Agile / Scrum and IT Architecture trainings, coaching and consultancy services.</p>
<h2>Why Agile?</h2>
<p>The reality of corporate IT departments and IT projects today is that most discussed topics are IT budgets, missed deadlines, dissatisfied business, and how expensive IT is. Instead, it should be about value creation and continuous improvement of delivery speed and quality of service. This problem is particularly visible when dealing with vendors or outsourcing partnerships. Agile and Scrum helps bring these subjects back on table and improve relationship with your customer or IT service provider.</p>
