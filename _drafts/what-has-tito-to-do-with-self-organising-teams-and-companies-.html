<p>Josip Broz Tito, or just Tito was a Yugoslav revolutionary. I haven't forget the moment I heard about his death in 1980. I was just 5 years old, born and raised in Bosnia. In those days, one of the Yugoslav republics. He was usually considered a dictator, but people loved him.</p>
<p>Today, I was having a conversation with friend of mine. We were chatting about Agile mindset, and about companies that brought this to a whole new levels. Companies that have no CEO, no or unusual managers, everyone chooses their own salary and so on.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all these things sounded familiar from our past in ex-Yugoslavia.</p>
