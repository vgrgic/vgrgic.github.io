<p>It is a delight to read Jim Highsmith's book: Adaptive Leadership: Accelerating Enterprise Agility. Jim tells his experience of the past 10+ years of AgileÂ and the current status of the movement. The first part is full of carefully selected phrases from many different individuals, writers. Each of them hits the sweet spot in my brain, producing an "a-ha" moment. The same effect have his personal experiences in many companies.</p>
<p>At one point while reading, I realised that Jim's extensive explanation of issues, challenges and solutions with Agile at executive level is also an answer to many questions about "scaling" Agile. Fortunately, he does not call this scaling.</p>
