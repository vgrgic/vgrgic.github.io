<p>When meeting people and talking about Agile and Scrum, I get to hear many different perspectives and opinions about it. The opinions are driven by the perspectives and experiences in the past. Quite often I get to talk to people who don't really like Scrum, don't like Agile, or both. One of the reasons is bad experience with Agile Coaches introducing Scrum for the sake of introducing Scrum.</p>
