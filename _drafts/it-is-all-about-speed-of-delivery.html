<p>As Jan Bosch presented very nicely in his keynote during LAC (Dutch congress for IT architects) a few years ago, all that matters today is Speed of Delivery. Besides speed of delivery, we already live in a world where following has become the mainstream:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumerization</strong> - businesses do not like to see their own IT department being slower comparing to solutions consumers get at lower price and higher quality.</li>
<li><strong>BYOD</strong> (Bring Your Own Device) might bring a death-blow to Microsoft predominated workplace. It is too expensive and business is spoiled by devies which cost a few hundred bucks and work better. So many customers I came across are complaining about their workstations standardized by their IT department.</li>
<li><strong>DevOps</strong> - difference between developers and operations is disappearing. Having your Agile team(s) taking care of most of operations is working like a charm. It is also much cheaper.</li>
<li><strong>Business solutions instead of generic solutions</strong> - driven by speed of delivery, we are starting to see that so-called generic solutions mostly that will solve many or all of their problems (read e.g. SOA, BPM, rules engines).</li>
</ul>
