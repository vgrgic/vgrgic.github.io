<p>Since the most popular blog posts have a title: ".... is dead! long live ....", I thought I should start one too.</p>
<p>Today, everybody is talking about Agile software development. It has become extremely popular. Many well-established roles are sacrificed in the process; which is good. Typical project management methodologies are replaced or marked as waste, which is even better. One thing we are not discussing much is the notion of a software project itself. Just like any project, software projects have a certain goal, a beginning, and the end. As we already learned in school, if a project does not have an end, it is not a project. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The question is, what do you call a Scrum team, which simply delivers one product sprint after sprint, and then suddenly switches to another product, and keeps delivering that one? Nobody knows the end-date, and nobody cares about the end-date. The budget is like a never empty bucket. As soon as it begins to dry out, a new to be gained value and money is found, team simply continues.</p>
<p>You can probably imagine this easily if your company is selling a software product and you have permanent teams. But, since Scrum came, more and more normal enterprises have this team. One or more stable teams, keep taking things from a product backlog, which is constantly refilled.</p>
<p>Software projects are usually separate and temporary entity in an organisation. They usually make a product, and give it to the IT department, which become responsible for operations. With a DevOps team, on other hand, the responsibility for operations moves sometimes completely from normal IT department towards the DevOps team. This creates sometimes weird situation where IT department is endlessly waiting for the "project" to transfer the responsibility, while business is very happy with the the current situation. The issue here is that organisation still treats this team as part of some project, while any aspect of a project is completely gone.</p>
<p>A similar situation might occur simply because IT department was not capable of delivering value to business. As a result, some business department decides to set up their own team, and deliver much faster. One negative effect here is that architecture becomes messy. This one department is more or less separated from the rest of the organisation.</p>
<p>What is actually happening is a slow death of software projects and programmes. The complex organisational structures for delivery of large systems are suddenly dissolving. Instead, there is just Scrum with Scrum teams and product owner is not even an IT person.</p>
