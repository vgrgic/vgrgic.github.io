<p>For the past 10+ years, I have struggled with concept called Enterprise Architecture. I began as a programmer delivering not really great systems, but they were usable and delivered pretty fast. After I finished my computer science education, for many years&nbsp;fulfilled&nbsp;software architect positions and last 7+ years I was often called enterprise architect, although I don't like the term at all.</p>
<p>Well, I learned so much B.S. about enterprise architecture, that I eventually started searching for a completely new ways of dealing with the question like "Why do we need enterprise architecture?". I didn't find the answer in&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;from others. Maybe only bits of it. Scattered all over the internet and books.</p>
<p>Many years ago I have embraced Agile Manifesto as a really great improvement in our profession. The only problem is, the are still no real answers how to deal with IT architecture and related questions.</p>
<p>Scott W. Ambler is probably the most known figure in the combination of Agile and Enterprise Architecture, but his <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/enterpriseArchitecture.html">article</a> about Enterprise Architecture starts like this:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">When project teams work under the assumption that they can do anything that they want, that they can use any technology that they want, chaos typically results. &nbsp;Functionality and information will be duplicated and reuse will occur sporadically if at all. &nbsp;Systems will not integrate well...</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know about you, but I find this nonsense. Even disrespectful towards guys and girls who actually build the systems.<br />So, based on Agile values I've started for number of years defining and applying my own way of dealing with IT architecture on project, programme and enterprise level.</p>
<p>This can be compiled into following principles. The correct formulation is still work in progress, so I welcome any feedback:
<ol>
<li>Teams committed to deliver parts of the enterprise landscape should also be responsible for the overall enterprise level architectural needs.</li>
<li>Any architectural framework, methodology or best practice is a potential waste unless proven otherwise by directly contributing in delivery of business value.</li>
<li><span style="background-color:white;">Enterprise architecture is defined just-in-time and emerges in the landscape driven by current business needs. At the same time directed by long term vision.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color:white;">Simplification of an enterprise architecture should be about the removal of unnecesary IT components instead of making nice looking drawings which usually oversimplify the real life complexity.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color:white;">The best enterprise architecture is also most refactored one.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>So, this is my first blog about dealing with enterprise architecture questions the agile way.</p>
