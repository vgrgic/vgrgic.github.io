<h3>      It's an impediment</h3>
<p>PSA stands for Project Start Architecture and is part of DYAÂ®. PSA documents are one of the most written documents by architects in Netherlands. The purpose of a PSA document is to connect "architectural thinking" with organizational changes. In less vague words: It makes sure that a project gets fences by stating principles, solution direction, guidelines and some decisions before the project starts. At the same time, it's not "solution architecture".<br />Still confusing? Well, it gets even worse. It describes also any or all of the following:
<ul>
<li>It makes sure that complete life cycle is taking care of by stating operational and flexibility requirements</li>
<li>It makes sure you talk less to people in other teams, because most things are already written down.</li>
<li>It makes sure you don't discuss standards, guidelines and standard solutions, because that's already done before the project starts.</li>
<li>Even the means to achieve the project goal are taking care of.</li>
<li>Actually, most of the choice are already made and written down in PSA.</li>
</ul>
<div>You can read it here:&nbsp;<a href="http://dsa.sogeti.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/White_Paper_Project_Start_Architectuur_1-0_nov_2007_tcm13-42134.pdf" target="_blank">White Paper: Project Start Architectuur</a> (dutch). There is even an <a href="http://www.dya.info/sites/dya.info/files/attachments/Point%20of%20View%20Agile_Architectuur%202012_0.pdf" target="_blank">"Agile Architectuur"</a> white paper written by the same company stating stuff like "PSA Scrum team" which is ridiculous considering they deliver a document which cripples the team and its creative freedom.<br /><span style="background-color:white;">Everything in this way of thinking is based on mindset that an Agile team should be kept on leash because otherwise chaos will emerge and an Agile team strives some other goal different from enterprise goals. I'll elaborate more on this in the following posts.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>PSA documents are one of the common impediments solved by putting them away and pushing team members to talk to others and think for themselves, instead of pointing at some document. Until they realize that everything document describes is better understood by talking to people or more often not even in line with changing reality.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:white;">Let's not forget that any document is just a mean to communicate with each other. It has no direct value.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>The worst thing of all is that whole purpose of this document is to prevent teams to think outside the boundaries of their assignment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyone who uses PSA documents does not use them as defined or does not understand Agile and Scrum.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>      But, what do I replace PSA with?</h3>

<p>When a Scrum team gets assignment, it will usually start iteration zero. In this iteration, the team talks to stakeholders, architects, domain experts, users and other teams, mostly by means of workshops (e.g. Product Vision Box). First and foremost, to understand functional and technical domain well enough in order to:</p></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>make only the necessary, costly to change architectural decisions, needed to start with first stories. E.g. programming language, user interface technology, dependencies on other systems.</li>
<li>know there are guidelines, dependencies, strategic goals and so on. The team will feel the responsibility to bring those back later on once they are affected by the user stories.</li>
<li>encourage discussion about correctness and validity of corporate standards, guidelines and choices.</li>
</ul>
<div>An Agile team will usually put some of this stuff on Wiki or improve corporate architecture Wiki, but most should be in heads of each team member. If it is too much to remember, than you probably have discussed too much stuff too soon.</div>
