<p><a href="http://less.works/" target="_blank">LeSS framework</a> is basically Scrum, only scaled-up. It is more an additional <a href="http://less.works/less/rules/index.html" target="_blank">set of rules</a> and a really good explanation on how to apply Scrum in a scaled situation and still remain effective, than a framework on its own. This is especially evident when compared to other scaling frameworks. LeSS can be used to work effectively on a single product with multiple teams, and even thousands of developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://less.works/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1768" src="https://vgrgic.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/less_framework.png" alt="less_framework" width="646" height="290" /></a>A particularly interesting part is the emphasis on <a href="http://less.works/less/technical_excellence/index.html" target="_blank">technical excellence</a>. It is one of the extremely important aspects often neglected in Agile introductions. Among things like clean code, TDD, continuous delivery, the framework also describes the way we should deal with <a href="http://less.works/less/technical_excellence/architecture_design.html">Architecture &amp; Design</a> in a very refreshing manner. Instead of creating additional organisational structure, roles and artifacts, Craig and Bas give a number of tips.</p>
<blockquote><p>Think ‘gardening’ over ‘architecting’—Create a culture of living, growing design</p></blockquote>
<p>This metaphor is intended as replacement for the building metaphor, which is usually used to describe what architecture means. The software systems are grown by incremental development, not built.</p>
<p>The rest is a large set of useful tips and direction of thinking when dealing with large scale Scrum. Here are few of these:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is so important that every act of agile modeling and programming for the life of the system should be treated as an architectural act.</p>
<p>Standard whiteboards are possible but not usually sufficient–and in fact are often an impediment, because modeling is best done on vast open wall spaces without borders.</p>
<p>Encourage everyone to question and challenge all these assumptions [early architectural choices] and decisions, and to find ways to apply the lean thinking principle of decide as late as possible or defer commitment.</p>
<p>Technical leaders teach during code reviews.</p>
<p>Communities of practice (CoP) are an organizational mechanism to create virtual groups for related concerns.</p>
<p>Internal open source with teachers—for tools too</p>
<p>Don’t use stubs to delay integration</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be captivating enough to make you visit <a href="http://less.works" target="_blank">the site</a>.</p>
